<h1>PhoREAL</h1>
<h5>Tools to make IceSAT-2 ATL03 and ATL08 easier</h5>

Data products from IceSAT-2 require some familiarity working with large datafiles and Hdf5 files.  PhoREAL is a library of tools and source code to help scientist and researchers more easily use Icesat-2 ATL03 and ATL08 data products.


<h3> PhoREAL v1.0 </h3>
• PhoREAL is a geospatial analysis toolbox that allows users to read in IceSat-2 ATL03 .h5 data files, process the data,
and output the data into several different file formats for further analysis including .las, .csv, and .kml.

• On Windows systems, the PhoREAL toolbox can be run as a Graphical User Interface (GUI) executable (.exe)

• On Linux systems, the PhoREAL toolbox can be run as a Python GUI or as a series of Python function commands via
the Linux command line

• PhoREAL also has the ability to classify ATL03 data points from the classifications in the ATL08 data product, trim
IceSat-2 ground track data by latitude or time, plot the resulting ATL03 data, and save any figures created
